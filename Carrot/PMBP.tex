\section{Abstract and Introduction}
This paper draws a new connection between PatchMatch(PM) and Particle Belief Propagation (PBP).
The key contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item description of PM and BP in terms that allow the connection between them be clearly described.
\item use of this analysis to define a new algorithm PMBP which is more accurate than PM and faster than BP. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Belief Propagation}
Correspondence field is parametrized by a vector grid $\{\mathbf{u}_s\}_{s=1}^{n}$ where $s$ indexes nodes ( correspondence to image pixels) and  $\mathbf{u}_s \in \mathbb{R}^d$ parametrizes the correspondence vector at $s$.
